        <p>because, by allowing tracking, you can be giving up <strong>way</strong> more information than you think! some examples:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>who you sleep with because both you and the person you share your bed with keep your phones nearby. [1]</li>
          <li>whether you sleep soundly at night or whether your troubles are keeping you up. [1]</li>
          <li>whether you pick up your phone in the middle of the night and search for things like "loan repayment". [1]</li>
          <li>your IQ based on the pages you "like" on Facebook and the friends you have. [1]</li>
          <li>your restaurant visits and shopping habits. [1]</li>
          <li>how fast you drive, even if you don't have a smart car, because your phone contains an accelerometer. [1]</li>
          <li>your life expectancy based on how fast you walk, as measured by your phone. [1]</li>
          <li>whether you suffer from depression by how you slide your finger across your phoneâ€™s screen. [1]</li>
          <li>if your spouse is considering leaving you because she's been searching online for a divorce lawyer. [1]</li>
        </ul>
